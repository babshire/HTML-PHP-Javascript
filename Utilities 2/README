This project is composed of 2 parts: The drawing pointer and the photo viewer and their features are self explanatory when 
looking at the interface.

DrawingPointer.php:
This is a simple drawing application that draws markers where the cursor is. 

PhotoViewer.php:
Retrieves photos from the specified folder location with the naming convention "commonname#.jpg". Creates a slideshow of the
photos from the folder.
